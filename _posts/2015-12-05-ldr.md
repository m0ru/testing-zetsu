[Florian](https://github.com/fkleedorfer) pointed me towards the [RDFjs-Mailinglist](https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-rdfjs/) in general and a post on the [LD-R framework](http://ld-r.org/) in particular a while back. The framework is intended to author reusable components for viewing, editing and browsing rdf-data (thus potentially solving parts of the challenges of this thesis work).

Also, their technology stack seems fairly up-to-date, consisting of:

* [ReactJS](https://facebook.github.io/react/) for component rendering
* [Yahoo Fluxible](http://fluxible.io/) as dispatcher in a  [Flux](http://facebook.github.io/flux/)-architecture
* [Semantic-UI](http://semantic-ui.com/) for styling

I've got a local installation up and running however am struggling a bit to connect it to an rdf-data-source. Also I'm working through the accompanying paper, [Adaptive Linked Data-driven Web Components: Building Flexible and Reusable Semantic Web Interfaces] ([Khalili](http://ali1k.com/), [Loizou](http://www.few.vu.nl/~alu900/), [van Harmelen](http://www.cs.vu.nl/~frank.van.harmelen/); 2015) trying to figure out how to implement more specific components (most of theirs seem to stay at an generic level to deal with any rdf). My goal for now will be to implement some domain-focused components (e.g. a map with shops and opening hours, ideally editable) to get a feel for the framework and see if covers the editing-part that we require fully and is flexible enough to also work with future component libraries (we won't be using React anymore five years down the line, I assume)

I'll post more updates once I get a better understanding of the inner works :)
